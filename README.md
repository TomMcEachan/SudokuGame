## C# Sudoku Solver Project

During my BSc Software Development degree, I was tasked with creating a Sudoku solver in C#. This was a fun project that allowed me to explore the use of recursion in programming. I was able to create a fully functional Sudoku solver that could solve any valid Sudoku puzzle. You can also use the application to generate a new Sudoku puzzle, which is then solved by the application or can be solved by the player. The application will let the player know if their answers are wrong. There are different modes for the application, including a timed mode, which allows the player to see how long it takes them to solve the puzzle. Additionally, there are different difficulties of Sudoku puzzles that can be generated, ranging from easy to hard.
